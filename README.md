## About

Personal portfolio for Satyam Kumar — a third-year B.Tech AI & ML student at VIPS-TC, GGSIPU. Built from scratch with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. No templates. No UI kits. Every component written and designed by hand.

The site showcases two deployed AI/ML projects, a vertical timeline of experience and education, an interactive skills section, and a certifications block — assembled into a fast, accessible, fully responsive site with scroll-triggered animations throughout.

## Featured Projects

### 🌊 Marine Trash Detection System
> Fine-tuned YOLOv8m-seg on 7,212 underwater images to detect and segment 16 classes of marine debris and sea life.

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | YOLOv8m-seg (instance segmentation) |
| Dataset | TrashCan 1.0 — 7,212 annotated images |
| Classes | 16 (8 debris + 8 marine life) |
| Result | **65.6% mAP50** |

## Design Notes

**Zero animation libraries.** All scroll-reveal animations use a single shared `useReveal` hook backed by `IntersectionObserver`. The `revealStyle()` utility in `lib/animation.ts` returns inline CSS properties — no Framer Motion, no GSAP.

**Profile image fades on scroll.** The hero section tracks `window.scrollY` and fades the profile photo from fully visible to transparent over the first 300px of scroll using a passive scroll listener.

**Project pages are self-contained.** Each project page is a single component file with its own data, gallery images, lightbox, and embedded HuggingFace Space iframe. Adding a future project means one new component file and one new route folder.

**No UI library.** Every component is plain Tailwind utility classes. No shadcn, no Radix, no MUI.
